				actual region/country is found to be different from the region/country in our records, PSPL may take
				appropriate action such as migrate your account or require you to migrate your account to the cloud
				facility
				corresponding to your region/ country or close your account and deny the Service to you. If you are
				served
				from a cloud facility outside your region/country and a PSPL group entity has an office in your

				<h2 class="fw-bold">REFUND POLICY</h2>
			</div>

			<p>
				At PSPL we strive to create quality software that you enjoy using for your business or professional
				life. You have a
				number of choices, and we appreciate you giving us your business. Thank You. We have created this policy
				that
				details what we will do should we fail to meet your expectations.
			</p>

			<p>
				Monthly Subscriptions. If at any time during your first month using our service you are dissatisfied,
				please contact
				us. We will do our best to address your issue, provide a work around or give a timeline for a solution
				that will
				meet your needs. If you are not satisfied, we will gladly offer you a FULL REFUND for your purchase, and
				downgrade
				your account to the free plan for that service.
			</p>

			<p>
				Annual Subscriptions. PSPL doesn't force you into an annual subscription as a condition to use our
				services. We
				prefer to give you the flexibility to choose. In exchange for you signing up for an annual up-front
				commitment, we
				offer you a significant discount over the already-low monthly subscription cost. If at anytime during
				your first 45
				days using our service you are dissatisfied, please contact us. We will do our best to address your
				issue, provide a
				work around or give a timeline for a solution that will meet your needs. If you are not satisfied, we
				will gladly
				offer you a FULL REFUND for your purchase and downgrade your account to the free plan.
			</p>

			<p>
				We want you to be happy with our service throughout your entire contract, not only the first 30 days (in
				case of
				monthly subscription) and the first 45 days (in case of annual subscription). So, we go beyond that. If
				at any time
				during your contract we remove, break or discontinue functionality that was available at the time you
				signed up for
				your contract, we ask you to notify us immediately. If we fail to address it on a timely manner to your
				entire
				satisfaction, we will offer you a PRO-RATED REFUND for the reminder of your contract.
			</p>

			<p>
				Auto-Renewal. For your convenience, your monthly and yearly subscriptions will auto-renew until you
				cancel the
				service. Every time before your subscription auto-renews, we will send a mail specifying the amount that
				will be
				charged to your credit card. Similarly, after each renewal we will send you a receipt via e-mail
				specifying the
				amount that has been deducted together with the next renewal date and the next renewal amount.
			</p>

			<p>
				We know that sometimes customers forget to cancel an account they no longer want until it is having
				already been
				charged. That's why you can cancel your monthly/annual subscription even five business days after your
				renewal date,
				and we will still process your cancellation and give you a FULL REFUND.
			</p>

			<p>For questions, please e-mail info@protostaff.com</p>
			<p>Exception to our Refund Policy</p>
			<p>
				Please note that we will not entertain a request for refund (FULL or PRO-RATED) when we have suspended
				or terminated
				your access to PSPL Services due to a violation of our Terms of Service.
